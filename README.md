# Jenkins packer templates
This repository contains templates for building machines on AWS running [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/). The images only install Jenkins, they do not configure the [recommended security controls](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/system-administration/security/).

## Contributing
Please feel free to create a pull request to contribute templates for running Jenkins on other operating systems.
